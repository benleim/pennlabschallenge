# pennlabschallenge

- Uses Alamofire (need to run pod install)
- Basically just hits the API with Alamofire and creates custom UITableViewCells and displays the information in a similar fashion to the current Penn Mobile app.
- Would like to have added more but didn't have time with the API switch & homework & whatnot.
- Happy to share code for other projects if interested.
- Feel free to email me wbleim@seas.upenn.edu if you have any questions.
